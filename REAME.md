## 📖 About the Project

Brainiac Bot is a Discord bot that serves as a personal "brain dump" system,
helping users maintain focus by providing a structured way to capture and
organize thoughts for later review. The bot allows users to quickly store
intrusive thoughts, tasks, and questions without losing their current focus,
then return to them when it's more convenient.

## ⭐ Core Features

- 📝**Brain Lists**: Personal collections for organizing thoughts
- 🎯**Brain Tasks**: Individual items from a Brain List
- ✅**Task Management**: Checklist-style entries within brain lists
- ⏰**Reminder System**: Time-based notifications for reviewing stored thoughts

## 📚 My Learning Journey

This project represents my first venture into Discord bot development. I'm
following the [Discord.js Guide](https://discordjs.guide/) to learn the
fundamentals of bot creation. This section will grow as I progress through
development and master new concepts.

### 🎯 Learning Path

Following the Discord.js v14 Guide, I will be documenting my progress through
these fundamental areas:

1. 🚀 Basic Bot Setup

- _Learning progress will be added here_

2. 💻 Command Handling

- _Learning progress will be added here_

3. 👩🏻‍💻 User Interactions

- _Learning progress will be added here_

4. 💾 Data Management

- _Learning progress will be added here_

5. ⭐ Advanced Features

- _Learning progress will be added here_

As I complete each learning milestone, I'll update this section with specific
concepts mastered, challenges overcome, and practical implementations in the
bot.

### 📝 Development Log

_This section will be updated as I progress through development_

## 🛠️ Technical Stack

- Discord.js v14
- Node.js v22.14 LTS
- Database (TBD)

## 📥 Installation
